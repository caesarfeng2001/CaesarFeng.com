                        <p> Hello! I am a 2nd year student at the University of Waterloo 
                            pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a Business Specialization. I am currently seeking software internship
                            opportunities for fall 2021, so please feel free to contact me with any related information. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It wasn't until the year 2018 where my I developed an interest for the field of computer science. After taking 
                            a few highschool courses in Python and Java, consulting my dad whose been in the industry for 30+ years,
                            and seeing the potential jobs I could end up working, I decided to pursue computer science and haven't looked back since.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My journey so far has been full of learning and exploring. With every project I take on, every internship I work at, i'm learning 
                            more than I could ever imagine. Being able to solve real-world problems and create software that directly impacts people's lives is 
                            what motivates me to continue in this path.

                            When I'm not focused on my academics or busy coding, you will most likely find me in the gym either playing
                            basketball or weightlifting.
                            I also have keen interests in fashion and traveling. If you ever want to chat about these topics, please reach out!
